# polynomial-function
This program provides an intuitive interface to assemble polynomial functions by creating terms (simple or complex) and linking them to create larger polynomials.
A ploynomial is of the form a0x^n + a1x^n-1 + ....
A simple term consists of a coefficient (real number) and an exponent (real number). 2(x)^2 and (x)^0.5 are examples of simple terms. A complex term on the other hand,
consists of a trigonometric function that accepts an argument and is multiplied by a multiplier. Both the argument and the multiplier could be simple or complex.
(x)^2 sin^2(cos(x)) is an example of a complex term.
The user builds the terms and them assembles them to form a larger polynomial. The program then prompts for the lower and upper values of the domain to plot the function.
The user has a choice to build rational function (p/q where p and q are both polynomial functions).
The program also gives a choice to plot the derivative function (f'(x)) and the area under the original function âˆ«f(x)
